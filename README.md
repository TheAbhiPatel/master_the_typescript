- Boolean, Number, String, Array, Tuple.
- Enum, Any, Void, Null, Undefined.
- Type inference and type annotations.

### Advanced Types:

- Union Types, Intersection Types.
- Type Guards and Type Assertions.
- Literal Types, Type Aliases, and Type Assertions.

### Functions:

- Type annotations for function parameters and return types.
- Optional and Default Parameters.
- Function overloading.

### Classes and Interfaces:

- Creating classes and objects.
- Constructors, Properties, and Methods.
- Inheritance and Access Modifiers.
- Abstract classes and Interfaces.

### Generics:

- Generic functions and classes.
- Working with generic constraints.
- Generic types in interfaces.

### Modules:

- Organizing code with modules.
- Exporting and Importing modules.
- Default exports and Named exports.

### Decorators:

- Understanding decorators in TypeScript.
- Creating custom decorators.
- Applying decorators to classes, properties, and methods.

### Enums:

- Enumerated types in TypeScript.
- Numeric and String-based enums.
- Type Definitions and Declaration Files:

- Working with external libraries and modules.
- Creating declaration files (.d.ts).

### Type Inference:

- How TypeScript infers types automatically.
- Best practices for explicit type annotations.

### Conditional Types:

- Using conditional types for advanced type manipulation.
- Namespace and Declaration Merging:

- Organizing code using namespaces.
- Merging declarations from multiple sources.

### Type Guards:

- Writing custom type guards for runtime type checks.

### Type Utilities:
